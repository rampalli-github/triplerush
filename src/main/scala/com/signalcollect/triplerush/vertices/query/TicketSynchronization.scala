/**
 * Tickets are used for synchronizing asynchronous operations on the TripleRush index.
 * An operation starts out with an initial number of tickets. The tickets are split up between sub-operations on the index
 * and returned by each sub-operation upon completion of that operation.
 *
 * If the initial tickets are not enough the sub-operation is not executed and it returns its tickets number multiplied by -1.
 * This means that the minus prefix indicates that the asynchronous operation could not be completed, for example because the
 * number of tickets was too low or the branching factor of the index operation too high.
 *
 * The initial ticket values can only ever be positive, so it is impossible for a correctly working component to return
 * Long.MinValue as the number of tickets.
